Mornington locals and visitors head to hidden gem 2 Left Sisters tucked away on Watt Road in the peninsulaâ€™s industrial area.  Winners of the AGFG Readers Choice Cafe 2023.
Named for two sisters who are "not quite right" as their husbands explained, the owners of this cafe run a drive-through and dine-in eatery. It is the place to head when the weather turns chilly; sit by the fire inside and join the lively buzz of conversation. Or come by for for a refreshing smoothie on a hot summers day.
