Mornington locals and visitors head to hidden gem 2 Left Sisters tucked away on Watt Road in the peninsula’s industrial area. Named for two sisters who own the café, this drive-through and dine-in eatery is the place to head when the weather turns chilly; sit by the fire inside and join the lively buzz of conversation, or choose to use the drive and stay warm and dry while picking up lunch.
